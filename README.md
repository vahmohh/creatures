Creatures is a machine learning software (GUI Application) employs the neuro-evolution algorithm to
train the neural network of the creatures that try to move faster than each other in a contest. Each
creature has eight angular motors that physically make them able to move. They have also a neural
network that coordinates their motors to move as fast as possible.
